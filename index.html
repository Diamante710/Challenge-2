           Hello, my name is Jessie Caban, I am a 29 year old, single father. While coding is an entirely new field of study for me, i am no stranger to hard work. I have spent most of my working years to date as a stonemason and prodction stagehand. I have obtained a permaculure design certificaiton and intend to use it to make my garden, as well as others, a more effiecient and self sustaining environment. 
           While this is only the begining of my education in this field, the knowledge i gain from this course will be used to change the direction of my work life. I intend to use the knowledge i gain here, as well in future courses, to be a part of developing AR and Hologram technologies.
